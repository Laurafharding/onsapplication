<p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>

	My name is Laura Harding, I am a post graduate student studying MSc Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University.<br><br>

	I completed an undergraduate degree in BA (Hons) Journalism at the University of Winchester, graduating in 2016, for which I received a 2:1. I decided to study a post graduate degree because having started to teach myself how to code, I discovered a passion for programming and realised I could combine this with the journalism I was already studying, and become a data journalist.<br><br>

	I am applying for the ONS Data Journalism Intern Scheme because I would absolutely love to gain some real-world work experience. I came straight from my undergrad degree to my master’s so I’m still only 21 and am yet to have a professional level job. I feel that in some ways this holds me back because often, jobs I’m seeing all require several years of work experience, but on the other hand, I am passionate that my skillset is going to be advantageous in ways that it wouldn’t have been pre-master’s.<br><br>

	If I were lucky enough to get a placement on this scheme, I would be able to prove that my lack of job experience doesn’t mean that I can’t be a data journalist! I’ve been working on several projects throughout my master’s, with several on-going.<br><br>

	The most recent, up to date project that has been completed was actually a group project as part of the course. The idea was to provide a user with an app that would allow them to loosely compare a journey they take by either train or car, with the measures of time, price and carbon emissions, with follow up stories exploring why travellers in the UK choose the method of travel that they do. It was an investigation into why train journeys are so expensive in the UK and if there was a simple reason for this. (There’s not).<br><br>

	The data we used included profits and margins of all of the Train Operating Companies (TOCs) from the Office of Rail and Road. We used this data to show what the government subsidies to TOCs was compared to what they paid back and made in profit.<br><br>

	For the project, I was responsible mainly for the back-end of the website. We used Django for the back-end framework, as we had scrapers running so needed somewhere that they could run. The scrapers of train-times websites and petrol price websites were made using python, and we displayed this on screen using JavaScript to manipulate a Google Map. I was also responsible for the front-end styling, a task I thoroughly enjoyed. We wanted the site to be a one-page continual scroll document which was a task in itself. It really developed my CSS skills and required a lot of time and concentration. I also produced d3 graphs for this project using the data sets and results of the user input.<br><br>

It’s far from perfect and there are still areas that require refining and improving, but it was the first model of the site that we produced. Unfortunately we don’t have a server for it as GitHub Pages doesn’t run the back end, but I am including some gifs of the website working.<br></p>

An area that I really enjoy working on is house price data. I’m currently building data visualisations from the House Price Index data available from the ONS. I’m aware that this is a topic that is regularly reported, but it’s for that reason that I like to produce my own work with the data. <br><br>
As a millennial, I’m more than aware of the difficulty I face in my future to own a home. This data really interests me because it’s so relevant and can help people to see where they could actually afford a home. I’m currently building choropleths on a national scale with the most up to date house price data. My next step would be to produce this on a hyperlocal scale, to really indicate where house prices are changing in a person’s local area.<br><br>

Having already started working with this data, it’s already quite easy to manipulate. There are various ways in which it could be displayed. I think maps are a great way to show this as they’re interactive and very visual. I think bar graphs are also helpful, as they show an easily comparable change in data. I would consider using post-code data for this story.<br><br>

I’m really interested how the economy fairs during elections and events such as Brexit. It’s something that affects absolutely every person and area in the country, so obviously, people are interested in these issues. I would be interested to produce an on-going story displaying what investments and trade deals with Britain are looking like, and at what point the stock markets are either succeeding or suffering. This would tie into inflation, GDP and various other economic data sets that are produced by the ONS. I think this could be a complex story and probably a business focused one, maybe for people who are in the business/economics industry. <br><br>

The audience wouldn’t necessarily be mainstream, but factors of the ongoing work could definitely be interesting to anyone. This more specific audience, however, would be wide and well established. I think graphs using self-updating data would be a really good way of showing real time economics.<br><br>

A third story that I’d be interested in producing regards employment. I’m interested to see migration of graduates, and where people are moving to work. London, as the capital, attracts thousands of people for work all the time, but if there was a way to map where workers across the country are coming from, I think it could be quite surprising.

I think it would be interesting for students to see where graduates are moving for work, and where their industry is hiring.<br><br>
